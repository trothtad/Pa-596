PA 596 - LORE COMPILATION
===========================

CLASSIFICATION: MOST SECRET - COSMIC
PREPARED BY: Development Team
DATE: 2025

===========================
CORE CONCEPT & TIMELINE
===========================

GAME CONCEPT:
Pa 596 - Tactical real-time strategy with persistent campaign layer
Core Fantasy: Desperate Cold War commander stopping unstoppable things using fragile, overmatched units and precious tech
Genre: Close Combat meets XCOM meets Cold War conspiracy horror

TIMELINE START: 1949 (moved back from 1959 for better tech/political situation)
- Keeps LoS important (aircraft optics/comms not great)
- Mechanised infantry combat not "solved" yet
- War surplus and postwar experimental tech available
- Rich political situation: Indochina, Arab-Israeli conflicts, decolonisation, post-partition India

===========================
THE DEEP ONES & KAIJU
===========================

THE DEEP ONES:
- Combat units of Deep Ones, aroused by heavy water experiments or other unknowable transgression
- Moved to action by nuking of Japan (or other reason - deliberately ambiguous)
- Political conflicts within Deep One society are opaque to humans
- Their development happens on scales of thousands of years vs human lifetimes

KAIJU STRATEGY EVOLUTION:
Phase 1: Enslave humanity (underestimated us)
Phase 2: Goad into using all nuclear weapons
Phase 3: Grind us down to nothing
Phase 4: Stalemate - feared human technological acceleration

THE COMPACT (post-game timeline):
- Signed with Queen Elizabeth (Queen A Lizard Birth - secret joke, never revealed)
- Ceasefire in exchange for "The Cancer" - alien virus that collects rare metals atom by atom
- Incredibly painful, spreads through body, produces platinum/gold/rare earth pearls
- Must be excised and tithed to Deep Ones

===========================
WORLD IN 1970 (POST-COMPACT)
===========================

THE MEDITERRANEAN COMPACT:
- Mediterranean sealed at Gibraltar and Suez
- North African nations independent but integrated into defense grid
- Joint NATO-Warsaw garrison forces

TECHNOLOGICAL ACCELERATION:
- Transistor revolution accelerated
- High-speed rail networks for troop movement

- Railgun artillery for fortress defense

THE CANCER ECONOMY:
- Voluntary (later involuntary) infection with alien virus

- Medical districts like company towns for the infected

REGIONAL CHANGES:
- Lee Kuan Yew as General leads Straits Federation (Singapore/Malaysia/Brunei)
- Indonesia fragments into three successor states
- Gaza as UN anarcho-capitalist protectorate producing kaiju detection gear
- Portugal loses Goa to kaiju annihilation, not annexation

===========================
KEY LORE ELEMENTS
===========================

THE SHANDONG PENINSULA LANDING (October 1950):
Menace-class emerges during Chinese Civil War chaos
- Both PLA and Nationalists think it's enemy secret weapon
- Creates mass refugee crisis amid ongoing conflict
- Taiwan becomes de facto safe zone (kaiju avoid deep water)
- Accelerates Sino-Soviet split due to mutual suspicions
- Mystery: was emergence natural or directed?

POLITICAL DYNAMICS:
- By 1951: Overt NATO-Warsaw cooperation begins
- Domestic political fighting: "those damn Commies started this!"
- Knowledge goes public during New Zealand Front
- Propaganda, conspiracy theories, mass panic follow

DECOLONISATION IMPACT:
- Both helps and hinders independence movements
- Portuguese Goa: garrison annihilated by kaiju, earlier "annexation"
- Some nations better off, others thrown into chaos
- Colonial powers can't maintain empires while fighting kaiju

TECHNOLOGY RACE:
- Bell transistor (1948) leads to accelerated miniaturisation
- Communications priority over rocketry/ICBMs
- Guided missiles for kaiju hunting
- Grounded sci-fi: twin-vehicle railgun with superconducting umbilical
- Particle cannons firing mercury ion pulses (Battletech PPC reference)

MILITARY EVOLUTION:
- Late-game kaiju attacks target R&D sites and Monster Fuckers
- Probing attacks to test human defensive improvements
- Environmental damage as tactical consideration
- Victory often "delay X turns" not "kill everything"

===========================
GAME MECHANICS CONCEPTS
===========================

LUDONARRATIVE COHERENCY:
- Every mechanic should tell the story
- Morale systems reflect horror themes
- UI/audio/mechanics support Cold War paranoia
- Asymmetric design: humans vs kaiju play completely differently

AFTER ACTION REPORTS:
- Dry bureaucratic documents revealing horror through admin language
- Unit progression and storytelling combined
- Political pressure shown through budget/priority changes
- Reports get "wrong" as system becomes complicit

CORE SYSTEMS:
- Unit persistence: veterans get bonuses, trauma gives debuffs
- Equipment degradation: damaged vehicles stay damaged
- Morale and psychological effects near kaiju
- Line of sight and communications limitations
- Multiple victory conditions (survival vs elimination)

ATMOSPHERE:
- 1950s military aesthetic with sci-fi flourishes
- Radio chatter in military jargon
- Environmental audio: Geiger clicks, wind, distant screams
- Bureaucratic horror tone throughout

===========================
