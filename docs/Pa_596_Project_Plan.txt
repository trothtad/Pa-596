## 1. Core Concept & Design Philosophy

**Genre:** Tactical real-time strategy with persistent campaign layer

**Core Fantasy:** You are a desperate Cold War commander stopping unstoppable things with fragile, overmatched units and precious tech. Every decision costs blood and morale.

**Inspirations:** 
- Close Combat (real-time tactics, morale, persistence)
- XCOM (resource management, strategic layer, permadeath)
- Combat Mission (detailed simulation, line-of-sight, suppression)
- Alastair Reynolds (grounded sci-fi, cosmic horror with physics)
- Cold War conspiracy fiction

**Key Differentiators:**
- Humans are always outmatched - victory is survival, delay, or pyrrhic
- Troops get worse over time, not better (trauma, exhaustion, equipment degradation)
- Persistent battlefield - dead tanks stay dead, craters remain
- Bureaucratic horror tone - dry reports concealing terrible realities
- Environmental destruction as tactical consideration

**NOT This Game:**
- Power fantasy where you unlock god-tier units
- RTS where you build up to overwhelm enemies
- Horror game with jump scares
- Lovecraft pastiche with tentacles and madness meters

## 2. Historical Timeline

### Early Signs & Cover-Ups (1939-1949)

**1939** - Russian icebreaker *Krasin* encounters something in Arctic. Entire crew lost except navigator who dies of exposure after reaching shore. NKVD seals all records.

**1942** - French colonial village near Hanoi found devastated. Colonial authorities blame Japanese. Survivors describe "something that shouldn't be."

**1943** - Giant salamander sighted in Lake Victoria region, Kenya. Dismissed as hoax. British submarine reports collision with "submerged mass" that wasn't there on sonar.

**1944** - Menace-class entity destroys Wehrmacht bunker complex in Normandy. Allied forces arrive to find German defenders already dead, facility melted. Attributed to experimental weapon malfunction.

**1944** - Taniwha caught in nets by Māori fishing crew off Kaikoura coast. Government confiscates catch, crew silenced. Known privately as "4Square Affair" after the dairy company that supplied the bribe.

**1945** - Post-war chaos obscures numerous incidents. Pattern not yet recognized.

**1947** - UK Admiralty observes persistent North Sea anomalies. Formation of investigation committee (later becomes MF(E) nucleus).

Revised Timeline Framework
Pre-Emergence (1939-1947): Whispers and anomalies

Scattered incidents, mostly covered up or rationalized
Pattern not yet recognized
These are the "looking back, we should have known" moments

The Goa Incident (Early 1948): Everything changes

First major, undeniable outbreak
Portuguese colonial garrison + local forces
Can't suppress this one - too big, too public
British observers present (maybe naval patrol nearby?)
Mass casualties, civilian panic
India annexes territory in aftermath (Portugal too devastated to object)

Response Phase (Late 1948-1949): Improvisation and panic

MF(E) forms from British observers/survivors of Goa
Brigadier Thornycroft was at Goa? Or commanded the naval response?
Other nations scrambling to form own units
US creates Task Force CRYPTIC (1949)
Equipment is whatever's on hand - WWII surplus, experimental prototypes
Doctrine doesn't exist yet, learning by dying

Escalation (1950-1953): It's everywhere

Multiple breaches globally
Shandong Peninsula (1950) during Chinese Civil War chaos
Korean Peninsula complications (1950-1951)
New Zealand outbreak (1951-1952) - can't hide anymore, goes fully public
Channel Incursion (1952) - Europe directly threatened
Emergency international cooperation (1952-1953)

The Grind (1953-1955): Professionalization under pressure

MF(E) and Task Force CRYPTIC develop doctrine
Specialized equipment being produced
Tactical nuclear weapons normalized
Civilian evacuations routine
Political systems straining
This is the "Mobile Force (Experimental)" era campaign

The Crisis (1955-1956): Breaking point

Multiple Campaign-class sightings
Coordinated attacks (Deep One strategy shift?)
New Zealand Southern Alps - Pā 596 defensive line
Human casualties unsustainable
Economic collapse imminent
Emergency negotiations begin

The Compact (Late 1956): Desperate peace

Ceasefire terms negotiated
Mediterranean sealed
Antarctica ceded
The Cancer introduced
World exhales, begins rebuilding under new reality

### Post-Compact Era (1960+)

**1970-present** - Uneasy peace. The Cancer economy. Technological acceleration. Regional conflicts continue but under shadow of Compact. Human civilization fundamentally changed.

## 3. The Deep Ones & The Compact

### Nature & Origins

The Deep Ones are *not* Lovecraft's Deep Ones, though the name persists in classified documents. They are:

- Ancient intelligence from oceanic depths
- Biology indistinguishable from magic/technology (Clarke's Law applies)
- Political structure opaque to human understanding
- Operate on timescales of millennia
- Combat units deployed are analogous to human use of animals or machines

### Arousal & Escalation

**Initial Awakening:** Unclear. Theories include:
- Heavy water experiments penetrating "wrong" depth
- Nuclear weapons use (Hiroshima/Nagasaki) perceived as attack
- Natural cycle of emergence (we're just arrogant thinking we caused it)
- Internal Deep One politics spilling over

**Strategic Phases:**
1. **Enslave humanity** - Initial strategy. Underestimated human capacity for violence and technological adaptation.
2. **Goad nuclear use** - Attempt to make humans use all nuclear weapons. Failed when humans realized the game.
3. **Grind to nothing** - War of attrition. Nearly succeeded.
4. **Stalemate** - Feared human technological acceleration. Humans learning too fast, adapting too well. War becoming unpredictable.

### The Compact (1969)

**Terms:**
- Ceasefire between humans and Deep Ones
- Mediterranean sealed at Gibraltar and Suez
- Antarctica entirely ceded ("White Dead Zone")
- Cook Islands becomes Deep One research station
- Okinawa as "cultural exchange zone" (limited diplomatic contact)
- Specific nations designated for tribute

**The Cancer:**
- Alien virus that collects rare metals atom-by-atom
- Spreads through human body over years
- Incredibly painful
- Produces platinum, gold, rare earth pearls
- Must be excised and tithed to Deep Ones
- Initially voluntary, later becomes involuntary in some nations
- Creates entire medical-industrial complex
- Black market in counterfeit pearls, body parts
- Medical districts like company towns for the infected

**Human Response:**
- Joint NATO-Warsaw garrison forces
- North African nations independent but integrated into defense grid
- Technological acceleration continues (arms race mentality remains)
- Sealed territories patrolled jointly
- Political tensions remain but subordinate to Compact maintenance

### Why Negotiate?

**Deep One perspective (inferred):**
- Human technological development exponential
- War becoming costly even for Deep Ones
- Risk of human strategic breakthrough (what comes after nukes?)
- Internal political faction wanting different approach
- Compact provides steady resource flow without risk

**Human perspective:**
- Extinction-level threat neutralized
- Time to rebuild and adapt
- Cancer economy provides leverage (humans control production)
- Hope for eventual understanding or better terms
- Alternative was losing

## 4. Monster Taxonomy

### Classification System

**Hound-Class:** Squad-scale threats (dog to elk-sized)
**Taniwha-Class:** Rhino to bus-sized (section to platoon threats)
**Menace-Class:** Tank to small house (company to battalion threats)
**Campaign-Class:** Colossal (strategic weapons required)

### Naming Conventions by Nation

**United Kingdom:** Fake Rainbow Codes (bureaucratic obfuscation)
- Examples: Copper Dust, Green Wheel, Blue Thunder

**Russia/Soviet Union:** WW2 Battles (connecting new horror to old trauma)
- Examples: Dniepr, Smolensk, Kursk, Stalingrad

**United States:** Alphanumeric + Slang (military-industrial naming)
- Examples: K-A12 "Colossus", J-88 "Jenny", P-14 "Prowler"

### Hound-Class (Current List - SUBJECT TO REVISION)

| Name | Description | Tactical Role |
|------|-------------|---------------|
| **Hellhounds** | Fast flankers, size of large dogs. Struggle in urban terrain, excel in jungle/bush. | Harassment, flank security threat |
| **Rootworms** | Burrowing constrictors nest in soft soil. Emerge suddenly. Russian tactic: bait with prisoners, incinerate nests. | Area denial, ambush |
| **Dapper Dans** | Skittering horrors firing poisoned darts. "A Little Dab'll Do Ya." Dangerous at 100m. | Ranged harassment |
| **Honeycrabs** | Light anti-armor melee. Cling to tanks, strike weak points with explosive tendrils. | Vehicle harassment |
| **Whistlers** | Mercury ion slingers. Hypervelocity one-shot kill potential, poor reload. "If they miss, you live." | Anti-infantry sniping |
| **Snatchlings** | Gangly bipeds with long arms. Drag isolated soldiers away. Not deadly alone, terrifying in fog. | Morale weapon, isolation |
| **Blowcows** | Gassy bloated beasts. Explode when shot. "Shoot one, kill three." | Trap, area denial |
| **Scissormen** | Two-legged insectile. Razor-jawed. Decapitate sentries cleanly. Silent but quick. | Infiltration, assassination |

**Gameplay Considerations:**
- Need to feel threatening without being frustrating
- Small groups should pressure, not overwhelm
- Ambush and surprise more important than raw damage
- Force player to maintain formation, not leave stragglers
- Some should force specific counter-tactics (don't shoot Blowcows near your own troops!)

### Taniwha-Class

| Name | Origin | Description |
|------|--------|-------------|
| **Copper Dust** | UK | Dense enzyme fog eats unprotected troops. "Rains rust on the bone." |
| **Dniepr** | RU | IR-invisible wall-shredder. Tires easily. Used in ambush. |
| **K-A12 "Colossus"** | US | Sonic artillery. Shatters trenches, ruptures lungs. |
| **Green Wheel** | UK | Rolling armored organism. Weak only from behind. Explodes on death. |
| **Smolensk** | RU | Semi-aquatic. Stalks through river deltas. Drowns squads with water-jets. |
| **J-88 "Jenny"** | US | Lures troops with mimicked human voices. Acid jets, armored carapace. |

**Design Intent:**
- Require concentrated fire or specialist equipment
- Force combined-arms response
- Each has weakness that must be exploited
- Named variants have personality in tactical behavior

### Menace-Class (Greek Titans)

| Name | Description |
|------|-------------|
| **Chronos** | Emits mental disruption. Troops hallucinate, panic. Weak to fire. Rare. |
| **Oceanus** | Immobile artillery beast. Crablike. Launches napalm & gas shells. Stuns via static. |
| **Crius** | Mobile melee threat. Rams defenses with armored skull. Avoid direct engagement. |
| **Themis** | Tall biped. Screams crack walls. Shoots directed pressure beams. |
| **Prometheus** | Spits fire from dozens of orifices. Immolates forests, trenches. |
| **Iapetus** | Burrows like Rootworms, tank-sized. Pops up under vehicles. |

**Tactical Implications:**
- Battalion-level response minimum
- Combined arms essential
- Possibly tactical nuclear weapons
- Victory often means "delayed" or "driven off"
- Environmental damage severe

### Campaign-Class (Greek Letters)

| Name | Description |
|------|-------------|
| **Alpha** | Snake-like, kilometers long. First confirmed megafauna. Altered river courses. |
| **Beta** | Lizardoid quadruped. Moves like mountain. 100+ kilotonnes. |
| **Gamma** | Insectile. Lays egg-sacs. Parasite vectors. Extinction-level without strategic weapons. |
| **Delta** | Flying behemoth. Hurricane-force winds when airborne. |
| **Epsilon** | No visual contact. Seismic only. Believed to tunnel continents. May not be alive. |

**Narrative Role:**
- Campaign-defining events, not regular encounters
- Player forces evacuate, observe, coordinate strategic response
- Victory is civilian evacuation, intel gathering, or delay
- These are what necessitated The Compact

## 5. Military Units & Factions

### Mobile Force (Experimental) 1st Battle Group [MF(E)-1BG]

**Nationality:** British Empire/Commonwealth  
**Formed:** September 1948  
**Commanding:** Brigadier R.A.F. Thornycroft, DSO & Bar  
**Motto:** "Videre et Vincere" (To See and To Conquer)  
**Strength:** 347 all ranks, 43 combat vehicles, 27 support vehicles

**Organization:**

**A Squadron "The Beasthunters"** - Heavy assault and fire support
- 3x Troops of Centurion Mk.3 (tungsten APDS, experimental ammunition)
- 1x Troop of Churchill AVRE (modified for close assault)
- Attached: Royal Artillery Forward Observer teams

**B Squadron "The Bloodhounds"** - Reconnaissance and infantry support
- Mixed Cromwell VIII and Comet tanks
- Infantry support vehicles (halftracks, Universal Carriers)
- Motorcycle reconnaissance section

**C Squadron "The Watchers"** - Signals, engineering, support
- Signals Section (experimental radio equipment)
- Engineer Troop (demolitions, fortifications)
- Supply and maintenance
- Medical section (attached Royal Army Medical Corps)

**Key Personnel:**
- **Lt Col "Bonzer" McKenzie** (ANZAC Exchange Officer) - A Squadron Commander. Veteran of North Africa and New Guinea. Knows jungle warfare, knows armored warfare. Combines both.
- **Major Patricia Blackwood** - Intelligence Officer, Cambridge xenobiology background. First to propose behavioral classification system for kaiju. Distrusted by old guard, essential to mission success.
- **Dr. Chen Wei-Ming** - Civilian scientific advisor. Hypercompetent autodidact, no formal doctorate. Fled China 1948. Expertise in chemistry, biology, whatever's needed. Never sleeps, chain-smokes, saves lives.
- **Squadron Leader "Biggles" Fortescue-Smythe** - RAF liaison. Coordinates air support. Perpetually cheerful. Survived 47 combat sorties. Everyone assumes he'll die tomorrow. Never does.

**Equipment Philosophy:**
- Mix of WWII proven kit and experimental prototypes
- Reliability over cutting-edge (cutting-edge gets you killed)
- Heavy emphasis on communication and coordination
- Specialist ammunition: tungsten penetrators, incendiary, experimental sonic rounds
- Modified vehicles: extra armor, escape hatches, fire suppression

**Doctrine:**
- Reconnaissance in force
- Deliberate engagement with prepared fallback
- Combined arms always (never send tanks without infantry, never infantry without support)
- Preserve force over killing monsters
- Intel gathering as important as combat

**Culture:**
- "Monster Fuckers" - gallows humor name, never official
- Tea breaks maintained even under fire (morale essential)
- Formal even in field (appearances matter for discipline)
- ANZAC contingent provides valuable "fuck the rules" perspective
- Scientific advisors integrated into command structure (not sidelined)

### Task Force CRYPTIC

**Nationality:** United States  
**Formed:** March 1949  
**Commander:** Colonel James "Iron Jim" Doolittle Jr. (son of the Doolittle)  
**Parent Organization:** The Black Chamber (resurrected cryptanalysis agency)  
**Director:** Colonel Frank "Cipher" Rowlett  
**Classification:** EYES ONLY - MAJESTIC

**Organization:**

**A Company "The Codebreakers"** - Heavy weapons and mechanized infantry
- M46 Patton tank platoons
- Mechanized infantry in M75 APCs
- Heavy weapons section (recoilless rifles, experimental directed-energy)
- 2x T95 "Super Heavy" prototypes (only two built, both assigned here)

**B Company "The Listeners"** - Signals intelligence and reconnaissance
- Radio intercept teams
- Electronic warfare specialists
- Scout platoons in jeeps and light armor
- IBM computing equipment (mobile, temperamental, essential)

**C Company "The Spooks"** - Special operations and scientific advisory
- Pathfinder platoon
- Demolitions experts
- Scientific Advisory Group (military and civilian mix)
- "Acquisition team" (looting enemy/kaiju technology)

**Notable Personnel:**
- **Lt Audie Murphy** - Yes, that one. Most decorated soldier of WWII now fighting things that don't die to normal bullets. Handles it with grim pragmatism.
- **Captain Grace Murray Hopper** - Signals intelligence. Building early computing systems for cryptanalysis and fire control. "It's easier to ask forgiveness than permission."
- **Dr. J. Robert Oppenheimer** - Security clearance "complicated." Advisory role. Guilt over atomic bomb finds strange outlet in fighting actual monsters. Chain-smokes with Dr. Chen when forces cooperate.
- **Colonel Chuck Yeager** - Air support coordination. First man to break sound barrier now coordinating strikes on things that break physics. Perpetually annoyed by paperwork.

**Equipment Philosophy:**
- Cutting-edge American technology
- If it's experimental, we'll test it in combat
- Overwhelming firepower doctrine (when in doubt, use more explosives)
- Computing and cryptanalysis equipment forward-deployed
- Logistics obsession (we will be supplied, period)

**Doctrine:**
- "Shock and Awe" before the term existed
- Combined arms with emphasis on firepower
- Air support integral to operations
- Scientific method applied to monster-killing (try everything, record results)
- Interservice rivalry subordinate to mission (mostly)

**Culture:**
- "We're all gonna die, might as well get paid" - contractor mentality
- Scientific advisors treated as equals (unusual for US military)
- Classified above Top Secret (most personnel don't know what agency they work for)
- Loose relationship with regular military chain of command
- Innovation encouraged, paperwork discouraged

### Other National Responses (Brief Overview)

**Soviet Monster Hunting Forces:** Brutal efficiency. High casualties accepted. Names units after WW2 battles. Integration of Gulag labor for "expendable" roles. Surprisingly effective doctrine development.

**French Colonial Forces:** Fighting kaiju and independence movements simultaneously. Doctrine developed in Indochina. Eventually overwhelmed. Veterans form nucleus of post-colonial forces.

**New Zealand Defense Force:** Fought first major land campaign on home soil. Civilian militias integrated. Māori units particularly effective (cultural familiarity with taniwha concept). Pā 596 named for their last stand.

**Chinese Forces (PLA/Nationalist/Warlord Remnants):** Fragmented response during civil war. Eventually unified against existential threat. Mass human wave tactics evolved into coordinated mass human wave tactics. Enormous casualties. Doctrine emphasizes expendable troops protecting valuable assets.

## 6. Campaign Structure

### Campaign Arc Philosophy

The game's campaign should feel like:
- **Act I (Goa):** Learning the rules, improvisation, "what the fuck are we dealing with?"
- **Act II (MF(E)):** Professionalization, specialized tools, "we have doctrine now"
- **Act III (Pā 596):** Mastery and desperation, "everything we learned, final stand"
- **Act IV (Dunwich):** Resolution and uncertainty, "maybe offensive for once, maybe answers"

### Act I: Goa (1954)

**Premise:** Portuguese colonial garrison + local militia facing first major Menace-class incursion.

**Player Forces:**
- Mixed Portuguese colonial troops (low morale, mixed equipment)
- Local militia (enthusiastic but untrained)
- Small British advisory contingent
- WWII surplus equipment
- No specialized anti-kaiju weapons

**Missions:**
1. **First Contact** - Patrol encounters Taniwha-class. Tutorial for basic controls, morale, retreat.
2. **The Evacuation** - Protect civilians evacuating Old Goa. Introduction to environmental destruction.
3. **Fort Aguada** - Defensive stand at colonial fort. Learning importance of prepared positions.
4. **The Menace** - Menace-class emerges. This is unwinnable. Survive X turns for extraction.
5. **Aftermath** - Coordinate rescue operations in ruins. Non-combat mission, exploring destroyed terrain.

**Narrative Themes:**
- Colonial system collapsing under pressure
- Improvisation and desperation
- Cultural tensions (Portuguese/British/local) subordinate to survival
- First attempts at doctrine formation
- Loss and learning

**Mechanical Introduction:**
- Basic unit control and line-of-sight
- Morale and panic mechanics
- Cover and elevation
- Equipment degradation (vehicles break, ammo runs out)
- Mission objectives beyond "kill everything"

### Act II: Mobile Force (Experimental) (1956-1959)

**Premise:** Play as MF(E)-1BG conducting operations in Southeast Asia and Pacific.

**Player Forces:**
- Specialized anti-kaiju unit
- Purpose-built equipment
- Scientific advisory team
- Combined arms doctrine
- Good intelligence support

**Mission Types:**
- **Hunter-Killer:** Seek and destroy specific Taniwha-class
- **Reconnaissance:** Gather intel on new kaiju types
- **Defense:** Hold position against waves
- **Extraction:** Rescue downed pilots, stranded scientists
- **Coordination:** Work with local forces (variable quality)

**Narrative Themes:**
- Professionalization of monster-hunting
- Cultural identity (British traditions vs pragmatic ANZAC influence)
- Scientific method applied to horror
- Inter-unit rivalry with US forces
- Political pressure and resource constraints

**Mechanical Development:**
- Veteran units with bonuses/trauma
- Specialist ammunition and equipment
- Call-in support (artillery, air strikes, limited nuclear)
- Multi-mission campaigns with persistent force
- Base management between missions

### Act III: Pā 596 (1961-1962)

**Premise:** Final defensive line in Southern Alps, New Zealand. Everything learned, nowhere left to run.

**Player Forces:**
- Combined MF(E), NZDF, and allied contingents
- Best equipment available
- Prepared defenses (player helped design them)
- Full combined arms capability
- But: stretched thin, exhausted, outnumbered

**The Situation:**
- Multiple Menace-class emerging
- Campaign-class sighted (Beta)
- Civilian population behind your lines
- Political pressure for victory (not just survival)
- Resources dwindling

**Missions:**
- **The Approach:** Delaying actions in foothills
- **First Line:** Defense of outer fortifications
- **Strategic Decision:** Choose which positions to hold, which to abandon
- **The Breach:** Something gets through. Desperate counter-attack.
- **Final Stand:** Pā 596 itself. Hold or die.

**Narrative Themes:**
- Everything learned being tested
- Sacrifice and cost
- Civilians vs military objectives
- Moral weight of command decisions
- Final stands and pyrrhic victories

**Mechanical Culmination:**
- All systems integrated
- Large-scale battles
- Strategic layer decisions matter
- Multiple objectives, hard choices
- No right answers, only acceptable losses

### Act IV: Dunwich (1963) [Epilogue]

**Premise:** Post-Pā 596. Intel suggests Deep One emergence site near Lovecraft's Dunwich, Massachusetts. Maybe offensive operation for once.

**Tone:**
- Different from rest of game
- Smaller scale, elite forces only
- Spec-ops feel
- Mystery and investigation
- Ambiguous victory conditions

**Purpose:**
- Narrative closure (or opening for sequel)
- Reward player with offensive capability
- Explore Deep One facilities
- Setup for The Compact negotiations
- Leave questions unanswered

**Mechanical Shift:**
- Stealth and infiltration options
- Non-combat puzzle elements
- Choices that affect Compact terms (doesn't change that it happens, but affects how)
- Multiple endings based on approach

## 7. Core Gameplay Systems

### Unit Morale & Trauma

**Morale States:**
- **Steady:** Normal performance
- **Shaken:** -20% combat effectiveness, may hesitate
- **Panicked:** 50% chance to ignore orders, may flee
- **Broken:** Unit routs, cannot be controlled until rallied

**Morale Factors:**
- Proximity to kaiju (worse for larger classes)
- Casualties taken
- Casualties witnessed
- Duration of engagement
- Leadership quality
- Unit experience
- Environmental factors (night, fog, rain)

**Trauma System:**
- Units that survive encounters gain experience bonuses
- But also accumulate trauma
- Trauma can manifest as:
  - Reduced maximum morale
  - Specific phobias (refuse to engage certain kaiju types)
  - "Monster-hardened" (bonus against fear, penalty to social skills)
  - Unpredictable behavior (sudden panic, sudden aggression)

**Recovery:**
- Rest and rotation (mission design must allow this)
- Medical treatment (limited)
- Replacement troops (untrained but fresh)
- Choice: rotate experienced traumatized troops or commit green reserves?

### Equipment Degradation

**Vehicle Systems:**
- **Optics:** Reduced view range and accuracy
- **Engine:** Reduced speed and maneuverability
- **Tracks/Wheels:** Immobilization risk
- **Weapons:** Reduced rate of fire, accuracy
- **Communications:** Isolated from command network

**Progressive Failure:**
- Light damage: -10% performance
- Moderate: -30%, risk of critical failure
- Heavy: -60%, major systems offline
- Critical: Immobilized, weapon jammed, crew bailing

**Repair:**
- Field repairs: Restore partial functionality (takes time, requires supply)
- Workshop repairs: Full restoration (requires returning to base)
- Salvage: Cannibalize destroyed vehicles for parts
- Choice: Commit damaged unit or hold back?

### Ammo & Logistics

**Ammunition Types:**
- **Standard:** Always available but least effective
- **AP (Armor-Piercing):** Limited supply, essential for Taniwha-class+
- **Incendiary:** Area effect, good against Hound-class swarms
- **Experimental:** Sonic, chemical, radioactive - very limited, unpredictable
- **Nuclear:** Strategic weapons, very limited, massive collateral

**Supply System:**
- Units track ammunition by type
- Must be resupplied from supply trucks or depots
- Supply vehicles vulnerable targets
- Running out mid-battle is disaster
- Mission planning must account for logistics

**Resource Scarcity:**
- Between missions: allocate limited supplies
- Prioritize units or spread thin?
- Save experimental weapons for emergencies?
- Political pressure to "save money" vs military necessity

### Line of Sight & Communication

**LOS System:**
- Terrain blocks vision (elevation, buildings, forests)
- Units can only engage what they see
- Fog of war is real (no omniscient player view)
- Kaiju sometimes visible at distance (Campaign-class), sometimes hidden (Hound-class ambush)

**Communications:**
- Units must be in radio contact to coordinate
- Radio vehicles extend command range
- Jamming (both ways - kaiju can emit interference)
- Loss of communication = units act on last orders + AI
- Historical comms limitations (1950s technology)

### Environmental Destruction

**Persistent Damage:**
- Destroyed buildings stay destroyed
- Craters remain
- Fires spread
- Bodies remain (morale impact)
- Next mission on same map shows damage

**Tactical Implications:**
- Destroying buildings creates rubble (new cover, blocks movement)
- Craters block vehicles
- Fires deny area, create smoke (blocks LOS)
- Civilian casualties have political cost
- Do you destroy the town to save it?

### Mission Objectives & Victory Conditions

**Not Always "Kill Everything":**
- **Survive X Turns:** Hold position until extraction
- **Evacuate Civilians:** Protect retreat to safe zone
- **Delay Enemy:** Slow advance, accept losses
- **Gather Intel:** Get close enough to identify, then withdraw
- **Lure Enemy:** Draw kaiju into prepared killzone
- **Recover Assets:** Extract scientists, salvage tech

**Failure Conditions:**
- Mission objectives failed
- Casualties exceed acceptable threshold
- Key units destroyed
- Commander killed/incapacitated
- Time limit exceeded

**Success Gradients:**
- **Decisive Victory:** Objectives achieved, minimal casualties
- **Tactical Victory:** Objectives achieved, acceptable losses
- **Pyrrhic Victory:** Objectives achieved, heavy casualties
- **Strategic Withdrawal:** Objectives failed, force preserved
- **Defeat:** Objectives failed, heavy casualties

### After-Action Reports

**Function:**
- Narrative delivery mechanism
- Bureaucratic horror tone
- Unit progression tracking
- Resource allocation
- Political pressure visualization

**Format:**
```
MOST SECRET - COSMIC
AFTER ACTION REPORT: OPERATION COPPER HARVEST
DATE: 14 March 1959
COMMANDING: LT COL McKENZIE, I.D. "BONZER"

SUMMARY:
Objectives partially achieved. Enemy Type-T17 neutralized
with loss of two (2) Centurion tanks, one (1) AVRE, and
forty-seven (47) personnel. Civilian casualties: four hundred 
and twelve (412) confirmed, estimated two hundred (200) 
additional missing.

A Squadron requests rotation. Combat effectiveness assessed
at 60%. Morale concerns noted. Recommend immediate replacement
of casualties and two (2) weeks rest before next deployment.

Request DENIED. Political situation requires immediate
redeployment. Replacement personnel attached. Make do.

[Handwritten note in margin: "Make do." They always say make do.]
```

**Content:**
- Dry bureaucratic language
- Horror revealed through euphemism
- Unit status updates
- Command decisions and consequences
- Political pressure mounting over time

## 8. Technology & Equipment

### Technological Development Philosophy

**Accelerated But Grounded:**
- Transistor revolution (1948) leads to faster miniaturization
- Military R&D prioritizes kaiju-hunting over ICBMs
- Lots of experimental dead-ends
- Successful tech spreads rapidly (existential threat focuses minds)
- By 1970: significantly ahead of our timeline in specific areas

**Areas of Acceleration:**
- Communications (essential for coordination)
- Directed energy weapons (vehicle-mounted particle beams, experimental)
- Materials science (armor, structures)
- Computing (fire control, logistics, cryptanalysis)
- Biological/chemical (understanding kaiju biology)

**Areas of Stagnation:**
- Space race (less relevant)
- Consumer goods (wartime economy)
- Civil infrastructure (everything goes to defense)

### Weapons & Equipment (1950s Era)

**Standard Anti-Kaiju Kit:**

**Infantry:**
- Recoilless rifles (M20 75mm, 106mm variants)
- Flamethrowers (effective against Hound-class)
- Shaped-charge weapons (PIAT, bazooka, early HEAT rounds)
- Experimental sonic grenades (unreliable, hurt humans too)
- WP (white phosphorus) for area denial

**Armor:**
- Centurion Mk.3 with tungsten APDS (UK standard)
- M46 Patton with experimental ammunition (US standard)
- T95 Super Heavy (2 prototypes, both with Task Force CRYPTIC)
- Modified Churchill AVRE for close assault
- Experimental composite armor (limited availability)

**Artillery:**
- 155mm howitzers for indirect fire
- Chemical rounds (various experimental agents)
- Smoke and illumination
- Nuclear-tipped shells (strategic reserve)

**Aircraft:**
- Ground attack: Hawker Hunter, F-86 Sabre
- Heavy bomber: Canberra, B-47
- Napalm effective against Hound/small Taniwha
- Tactical nuclear delivery (last resort)

**Experimental/Prototype:**
- **Railguns:** Twin-vehicle setup with superconducting umbilical. High penetration, temperamental, ridiculous logistical requirements. Multiple experimental units fielded, codenamed MULE and SLING. MULE reactor vehicle used to power a number of systems.
- **Particle Cannons:** Mercury ion pulse weapons (inspired by Battletech PPC). Vehicle-mounted. Explosive charge pumps a magnetic flux which accelerates mercury ions. Massive magnetic field can cause somatic effects in operators. Overheating issues. Maybe 20 systems fielded by 1965.
- **Sonic Weapons:** Various attempts at weaponized sound. Most hurt humans as much as kaiju. Some success with high-frequency directed energy. Still experimental in 1962.
- **Biological Agents:** Chemical warfare adapted for kaiju. Nerve agents sometimes work, sometimes enrage. Ethical concerns. Limited deployment. Fluorine effective against the highly calcified kaiju.

### Technology in 1970+ (Post-Compact)

**Mature Technologies:**
- High-speed rail networks (troop movement, evacuation)
- Particle beam weapons (now standard on heavy vehicles)
- Advanced computing (distributed networks, early internet for military)
- Composite armor (standard on new builds)
- Fortification engineering (lessons from Pā 596)

**New Developments:**
- Deep One technology salvage (barely understood, barely works)
- "The Cancer" medical technology (excise without killing host)
- Detection systems for Deep One activity
- Gibraltar/Suez sealing technology (experimental megastructures)

**Still Don't Have:**
- Rocketry/space (not priority, far behind our timeline)
- Consumer electronics (military only)
- Medical advances except kaiju-related
- Many civilian technologies we take for granted

## 9. The World in 1970

### Political Landscape

**Mediterranean Compact Zone:**
- Gibraltar sealed with massive walls and naval patrols
- Suez sealed similarly
- North African nations independent but integrated into defense grid
- Joint NATO-Warsaw garrison forces
- Mediterranean itself mostly evacuated
- Fishing rights traded like currency
- "Cultural exchange" tourism to sealed zones (morbid)

**Changed Nations:**

**Straits Federation** (Singapore/Malaysia/Brunei)
- Led by General Lee Kuan Yew (never gave up military command)
- Highly militarized but prosperous
- Major port for Pacific trade (Suez closure changed everything)
- Excellent kaiju detection systems (exports worldwide)

**Indonesia** (Fragmented)
- Three successor states after collapse during kaiju wars
- Java Republic, Sumatra Federation, Eastern Alliance
- Ongoing tensions, occasional cooperation against threats
- Major source of refugees

**Gaza Protectorate**
- UN anarcho-capitalist experiment (everyone wants out)
- Produces best kaiju detection gear (necessity + capitalism)
- Technically independent, effectively international R&D zone
- Ethically questionable experiments (no oversight)
- Surprising stability (profit motive transcends politics)

**Portugal**
- Lost all colonies early (too weak to hold during chaos)
- Goa annihilated 1954 (India annexed remains)
- Angola/Mozambique independent early
- Domestic fascism ended during crisis
- Now minor European power, bitter about losses

**China** (Unified by Necessity)
- CCP victorious but changed by cooperation with Nationalists against kaiju
- Sino-Soviet split deeper (mutual suspicion over Shandong)
- Taiwan de facto independent (Deep Ones avoid deep water, created safe zone)
- Mass conscription culture normalized
- Enormous casualties, rebuilt quickly

### Sealed Territories

**Antarctica - "White Dead Zone":**
- Entirely ceded to Deep Ones per Compact
- All bases evacuated 1969-1970
- Scientific equipment abandoned
- Occasional satellite surveillance (treaty allows)
- Rumors of Deep One structures visible from orbit
- No human return expected

**Cook Islands - Deep One Research Station:**
- Population evacuated, compensated
- Now Deep One above-water facility
- Purpose unknown
- Human ships approach at risk
- Occasional "invitations" for human scientists (few return, those who do are changed)

**Okinawa - Cultural Exchange Zone:**
- US base remains but downsized
- Joint human-Deep One "embassy"
- Carefully controlled contact
- Intelligence gathering disguised as diplomacy
- Eeriest place on Earth (both sides watching each other)

### The Cancer Economy

**Production:**
- Voluntary infection initially (desperate for money)
- Some nations make involuntary (prisoners, dissidents)
- Medical districts like company towns
- Entire economies built around harvest/excision
- 5-20 year infection cycle typical
- Excruciatingly painful (palliative care major industry)

**Products:**
- Platinum, gold, rare earth pearls
- Atom-by-atom purity (valuable for electronics)
- Tithed to Deep Ones per capita quotas
- Surplus enters black market
- Counterfeit pearls (death penalty in most nations)
- Body part trafficking (infected organs worth fortune)

**Social Impact:**
- "Cancer volunteers" viewed as heroes or fools
- Medical tourism to "infection clinics"
- New class: "the Afflicted"
- Political movements: Cancer Rights, End the Tribute
- Some seek infection for wealth, others to avoid it at all costs
- Generational trauma: children of Afflicted often Afflicted

### Society & Culture

**Militarization:**
- Permanent wartime footing (Compact or no Compact)
- Universal conscription in most nations
- Civil defense drills routine
- Fortification architecture standard
- Bunkers in every building code

**Surveillance State:**
- Monitoring for Deep One activity
- Political paranoia (are they infiltrating?)
- Advanced computer networks for detection
- Privacy eroded for security
- Resistance movements growing

**Information Control:**
- War censorship never lifted
- Media heavily controlled (officially "for security")
- Samizdat networks distributing truth
- Conspiracy theories (some true)
- Generation gap: those who remember vs those who only know this

**Arts & Culture:**
- Apocalyptic literature/film boom
- "Mondter Fuckers" subculture (dark humor, tattoos, music)
- Brutalist architecture dominant (function over form, fortification aesthetic)
- Rejection of pre-war optimism
- New religions (some worship Deep Ones, some apocalyptic Christianity/Islam)

**Technological Divide:**
- Military tech advanced, civilian stagnant
- Dual-use tech restricted (computing, comms, materials)
- Black market for military surplus
- Haves (connected to military-industrial complex) vs have-nots

## 10. Sequel Hooks & Future Concepts

### Yithian Threat (Potential Sequel)

**Setup:**
- Yithians (Great Race from Lovecraft) exist in this timeline
- Time-manipulation beings seeking strategic advantage
- View human-Deep One Compact as opportunity

**The Europa Launch:**
- Yithians control/breed/generate vessel near Jupiter's moon Europa
- Launch toward Earth (years of travel)
- Potential breach of Compact with Deep Ones
- Deep Ones stalemated by humanity, other Mythos races see weakness

**Strategic Situation:**
- By late 1960s, human weapons evolved significantly
- Bomb-pumped lasers (theoretical)
- Nuclear pulse propulsion (Orion project)
- Nuclear thermal rockets (NERVA)
- Nuclear saltwater rockets (insane but possible)

**Gameplay Shift:**
- Space combat? Orbital defense?
- Time manipulation mechanics?
- Three-way conflict: Humans vs Deep Ones vs Yithians?
- Political: maintain Compact or exploit chaos?

**Themes:**
- Humanity as spacefaring species (forced by threat)
- Deep Ones as... allies? Enemy of my enemy?
- Cosmic horror escalation
- Is anywhere safe?

### Other Hooks

**The Dunwich Facility:**
- What did players find in Act IV?
- Deep One breeding programs?
- Ancient technology?
- Portal to other dimensions?
- Remains unexplained, player imagination fills gaps

**The Compact Unravels:**
- What if Deep Ones break treaty?
- What if humans break treaty?
- Factions on both sides wanting war
- Political thriller in post-apocalyptic setting

**Other Mythos Entities:**
- Shoggoths (Arctic? Antarctic?)
- Mi-Go (Himalayas? Andes?)
- Fungi from Yuggoth
- Each requires different response

**Human Faction Conflicts:**
- NATO vs Warsaw Pact tensions remain
- Resource conflicts over Cancer production
- Some nations want to renegotiate Compact
- Independence movements in occupied territories

**Technological Singularity:**
- Accelerated computing development
- Early AI (1970s instead of 2000s)
- What if AI could fight kaiju?
- What if AI sides with Deep Ones?

## 11. LLM Integration Ideas

### Design Philosophy for LLM Use

**Core Principle:** LLMs interpret and voice the game, they don't *run* the game. Keep simulation authoritative. Use LLMs for what they're good at: making structured information feel alive. Note: LLM integration is low priority consideration. Build game systems first.

### 1. The Constrained Oracle

**Concept:** NPC oracle/intelligence officer who provides cryptic insights.

**Implementation:**
- Feed LLM mission context, enemy types, terrain
- Ask for "intelligence briefing" or "tactical advice"
- Constrain output format (must be brief, military language)
- Can be wrong (unreliable narrator)
- Personality: nervous analyst, grizzled veteran, conspiracy theorist

**Gameplay Value:**
- Player feels like they're getting intel from real person
- Adds uncertainty (is this accurate?)
- Emergent narrative from interaction
- Replayability (different advice each time)

### 2. After-Action Report Generation

**Concept:** LLM reads simulation results and writes bureaucratic horror report.

**Implementation:**
- Simulation tracks everything that happened
- Feed structured data to LLM:
  - Unit movements and casualties
  - Engagement outcomes
  - Environmental destruction
  - Mission objectives status
- LLM generates report in specific style:
  - Dry bureaucratic language
  - Euphemisms for horror
  - Political pressure notes
  - Handwritten margin notes

**Example Output:**
```
MOST SECRET - COSMIC
AFTER ACTION REPORT: OPERATION COPPER HARVEST

SUMMARY:
Target neutralized. Acceptable losses. Civilian casualties
within predicted parameters. Unit requests rotation.
Request DENIED.

[Margin note: "Private Morrison refused to advance after 
the Scissorman took Henderson. He spent the rest behind 
the halftrack. He's requesting transfer. Recommend approval."]
```

**Gameplay Value:**
- Narrative delivery that feels real
- Makes player decisions feel weighted
- Shows progression of political pressure
- Unit personality emerges from repeated reports

### 3. The Editorial Board (Multi-LLM Synthesis)

**Concept:** Simulate internal debate using multiple LLM prompts.

**Implementation:**
- Different prompts for different "advisors"
- Prompt A: "You are cautious. Emphasize risks."
- Prompt B: "You are aggressive. Emphasize opportunities."
- Prompt C: "You are scientific. Emphasize unknowns."
- Combine outputs into coherent briefing

**Gameplay Value:**
- Shows complexity of decision-making
- Player sees multiple perspectives
- Feels like real military staff meeting
- Different advisors can be right in different situations

### 4. Trauma Dialogue System

**Concept:** NPCs describe experiences based on what actually happened to them in simulation.

**Implementation:**
- Track what each unit experienced:
  - Kaiju types encountered
  - Casualties witnessed
  - Near-death experiences
  - Mission outcomes
- Feed to LLM with personality constraints
- Generate dialogue that feels authentic

**Example:**
```
Simulation: Unit "Baker-3" witnessed Scissorman kill squad leader,
took 40% casualties, held position for 2 hours, mission success.

LLM Output (veteran sergeant): "Yeah, we held. Lost Thompson to 
that fucking Scissorman. Just... *click* and he's gone. The boys 
did their job though. They always do."
```

**Gameplay Value:**
- Units feel like people, not statistics
- Trauma system becomes narrative
- Player cares about preservation
- Emergent storytelling

### 5. Dynamic Mission Briefings

**Concept:** Mission briefings that respond to campaign state.

**Implementation:**
- Feed LLM:
  - Current strategic situation
  - Player's recent performance
  - Available resources
  - Enemy activity
- Generate briefing that feels contextual
- Include: objectives, intel, commander's concerns, political pressure

**Gameplay Value:**
- Each mission feels part of larger campaign
- Political/strategic context clear
- Personality of command structure emerges
- Increased immersion

### 6. Kaiju Behavior Narration

**Concept:** LLM narrates kaiju actions in evocative language.

**Implementation:**
- Simulation determines kaiju behavior mechanically
- LLM describes it poetically/horrifically
- "The Taniwha circles the building, acid dripping from its maw"
- "Something moves in the treeline. Your men freeze."

**Gameplay Value:**
- Mechanical actions feel scary
- Ambiguity increases tension
- Literary quality without sacrificing gameplay
- Can hint at things player can't see yet

### Technical Considerations

**Latency:**
- Pre-generate where possible
- Cache common outputs
- Only use LLM for unique situations
- Have fallback non-LLM text

**Consistency:**
- Track conversation history
- Reference previous outputs
- Maintain character voice
- Avoid contradictions

**Cost:**
- Only call LLM when adds value
- Batch requests where possible
- Use smaller models for simple tasks
- Consider offline models for release

**Player Control:**
- Option to disable LLM features
- Toggle between generated and static text
- Don't make LLM mandatory for gameplay
- Graceful degradation if LLM fails

## 12. Design Philosophy & Ludonarrative Coherence

### Core Tenets

**1. Every Mechanic Tells the Story**

The game's systems should communicate the themes through gameplay, not cutscenes or dialogue.

- **Morale system** → Horror and human fragility
- **Equipment degradation** → War of attrition, unsustainable
- **Logistics** → Desperation and scarcity
- **Persistent damage** → Permanent cost of violence
- **Trauma** → Psychological reality of combat
- **Objectives beyond killing** → War is more than body counts

**2. Respect Player Intelligence**

Don't explain everything. Let players figure things out. Trust them to understand themes through mechanics.

- Show don't tell
- Provide tools, not solutions
- Multiple valid approaches
- Let players make bad decisions (and learn from them)

**3. Bureaucratic Horror**

The tone is dry, administrative, procedural. Horror emerges from mundanity.

- After-action reports, not dramatic narration
- Statistics and casualties, not gore
- Political pressure through memos, not cutscenes
- System complicity shown through paperwork

**4. No Power Fantasy**

This is not about becoming powerful. This is about desperate competence against impossible odds.

- Units don't level up infinitely
- Best troops are traumatized troops
- Technology helps but doesn't solve problems
- Victory is often "survived" not "won"

**5. Environmental Storytelling**

The world tells the story. Maps, ruins, abandoned equipment.

- Persistent damage shows cost
- Civilian areas vs military zones
- Destroyed units remain on battlefield
- Environmental changes tell narrative

### What This Game Is About

**Thematically:**
- Cost of war
- Human adaptability and resilience
- Bureaucracy's dehumanization
- Trauma and recovery
- Collective action against existential threat
- Moral weight of command

**Mechanically:**
- Resource management under pressure
- Risk assessment and mitigation
- Combined arms tactics
- Imperfect information
- Long-term consequences of short-term decisions

**Emotionally:**
- Tension and release
- Pride in competence
- Grief over losses
- Dark humor as coping mechanism
- Occasional hope despite odds

### What This Game Is NOT About

- Individual heroism
- Becoming godlike
- Simple good vs evil
- Clean victories
- Reversible decisions
- Comforting answers

### Ludonarrative Coherence Checklist

When designing any system, ask:

1. **Does this mechanic support the theme?**
   - If not, cut it or change it.

2. **Does this feel true to the setting?**
   - Would 1950s military actually do this?
   - Does the technology fit?

3. **Does this create interesting decisions?**
   - Not just hard, but meaningful
   - Multiple valid approaches

4. **Does this respect the player?**
   - Not punishing for experimentation
   - Not holding hands
   - Clear feedback

5. **Does this serve the tone?**
   - Bureaucratic horror, not jump scares
   - Grim, not edgy
   - Dark humor, not jokes

### Success Metrics

The game succeeds if players:
- Feel clever when they win
- Feel grief when units die
- Make hard choices willingly
- Talk about "their" battle stories
- Respect the enemy (kaiju are threats, not punching bags)
- Understand themes without explicit explanation

The game fails if players:
- Feel like they're grinding numbers
- Min-max without narrative consideration
- View units as disposable resources
- Get bored during successful missions
- Need cutscenes to understand what's happening
- Feel the game is "unfair" vs "hard but fair"
