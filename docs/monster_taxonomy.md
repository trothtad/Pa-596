## Hound-Class
*Squad-scale threats, generally from dog to elk-sized. Often encountered in small packs or as lone hunters.*

| Name | Description |
|------|-------------|
| **Hellhounds** | Small, fast flankers. Can tear through jungle or bush but struggle in urban areas. |
| **Rootworms** | Burrowing constrictors that nest in soft soil. Emerge suddenly. Russian tactic: bait with prisoners, then incinerate nests. |
| **Dapper Dans** | Skittering horrors firing poisoned darts. Battlefield phrase: "A Little Dab'll Do Ya." Dangerous even at 100m. |
| **Honeycrabs** | Light anti-armour melee threat. Cling to tanks, strike weak points with explosive tendrils. |
| **Whistlers** | Mercury ion slingers. Fire bursts of hypervelocity shots. One-shot kill potential but poor reload. "If they miss, you live." |
| **Snatchlings** | Gangly bipeds with long arms. Focus on dragging isolated soldiers away. Not deadly alone, but terrifying in fog. |
| **Blowcows** | Gassy bloated beasts. Explode when shot. Common ambush trap. "Shoot one, kill three." |
| **Scissormen** | Two-legged, insectile. Razor-jawed. Known to decapitate sentries cleanly. Silent but quick. |

## Design Notes

### Naming Conventions by Nation:
- **UK:** Fake Rainbow Codes (Copper Dust, Green Wheel) - bureaucratic obfuscation
- **Russia:** WW2 Battles (Dniepr, Smolensk) - connecting new horror to old trauma
- **USA:** Alphanumeric + Slang (K-A12 "Colossus", J-88 "Jenny") - military-industrial complex

### Tactical Implications:
- **Hound-class:** Require infantry screens, area denial, close-range weapons
- **Taniwha-class:** Need concentrated fire, armored response, specialist teams
- **Menace-class:** Battalion-level response, combined arms, possibly tactical nukes
- **Campaign-class:** Strategic assets only, civilian evacuation priority, accept losses

### Behavioral Patterns:
- Drawn to sound and heat
- Some respond to radio/electronic emissions
- Terrain preferences vary (aquatic, burrowing, urban-phobic)
- Pack behavior in Hound-class, generally solitary above that
