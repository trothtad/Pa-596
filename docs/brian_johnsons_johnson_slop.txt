My hand slides under her shirt, tracing the contours of her spine. The slow, deliberate movement ignites her mechanoreceptors, generating a current that speaks safety and pleasure. Microbursts lift the skin into goosebumps. Her hair stands perpendicular, increasing the drag of my fingertips. She asks for more. 

My left hand anchors the curve of her waist, pulling her close. My arms establish a perimeter of safety, holding back the world’s chaos.  The warmth soothes and excites.  Her vagus nerve activates, pulling her breath down deep and slow.  For days, we’ve architected this moment in messages. Our imaginations have already lived this. The pent-up energy radiates. 

My heart aches with affection for this woman. Her nervous system knows. It is the architecture of her cognition that pulls me in. She is Van Gogh, painting the world with the turbulence of possibility. Light pours in; her mind refracts it into color, shattering the monochrome of the status quo.

My lips brush her cheek; my hands hold the nape of her neck.  The firm pressure asks her prefrontal cortex to stand down. She surrenders. This sacred entrance is earned. A thousand acts of reliability and trust precede. I whisper that she’s been missed, that I’ve longed. Deep within her cells, chromatin relaxes, inviting repair.  Wholeness saturates us. 

My lips press against hers; sensual want cascades through our nervous systems. My primitive brain tastes her chemistry, decoding the ancient immunological match.

My hand glides over her abdomen to caress her breast. Her breath pulses, ragged and sharp, as her limbic system overrides the conscious mind. I circle the delicate skin of the areola. My fingertips graze the nipple. The tissue contracts and hardens. A current travels inward, awakening her.  She’s wet, though her body is not yet ready for entry. Nor am I finished tapping out the patterns of affection.  

I slowly trace my hand down her body, mapping the terrain. I stop. It is calculated. Her hips rise, searching for the lost momentum.  She makes a sound—half frustration, half plea.  I’m in awe of the creation before me. 

I continue, taking a new route. Brushing close to tease. She wants more but must wait. The tension floods her brain with dopamine; oxytocin must follow. She craves union.

Increased blood flow pulses serum through the vaginal walls, lubricating. Her cervix begins to tent, lifting the uterus in preparation. Too soon, and pain dominates. In concert with the symphony of her body, bliss awaits. 

Her vestibular bulbs engorge, forming a soft, pressurized cuff.  Her anatomy has remodeled itself for the dance. We merge. Our brain signals collapse into synchrony, phase-locking. No longer are we distinct neural patterns, but one shared waveform. 

Rhythmic motion now resolves as music.  Beads of sweat surface as we sway in concordance. Want washes over us, commanding all. Our egos quiet as the frontal cortex dims; future, past, and death evaporate. Now is all that exists.  

We are transported into the tesseract, floating in and out of each other. Gravitational waves of motion compose a music of rapture. We climb toward the peak, descend again, maintaining perfect tension. Her legs wrap around me, demanding more. Boundaries are erased. Full body release waits in suspended agony, yet we stubbornly refuse to concede there is an end.

We will grow young together.

She ascends. The pelvic floor contracts rhythmically. A tidal wave of oxytocin lands ashore, bonding what logic cannot break. Hunger vanishes as prolactin signals all-consuming satisfaction. The cervix dips; the uterus contracts, drawing in the possibility of new life.  

We lie together, interwoven. Her head rests on my chest as I trace the sheen on her back.  Outside this room, entropy reigns. Inside this room, our union commands repair; decay retreats. Our deep companionship has been earned. We bathe in the quiet certainty that we are one.

They fell from grace because they sought knowledge. We seek knowledge to claw our way back in.
